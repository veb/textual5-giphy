# textual5-giphy
Respond with a gif from giphy

Probably breaks. Haven't spent much time on it, but was something I was
interested in seeing if it could be done easily.

Make sure you place the file in `~/Library/Application Scripts/com.codeux.irc.textual5`

Refer to https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI#request-a-production-key to get your
own API key. At the moment the current key is their public beta key, so it will
work with restrictions.

Make sure you `chmod +x` it too, otherwise it won't run. 

Then you can type `/giphy hello` on your Textual5 client.
